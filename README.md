# diabeticLR
Trained a Diabetes prediction Model using the Pima Indian Dataset.
We checked for the assumptions a Logistics Regression function is supposed to have.
Normalized the data using the StandardScaler function. 
We trained and fitted a base Model for the dataset.
Using GridsearchCV, we tuned the hyperparameters for the Logistics Regression Model. 
Then we trained and fit a new Logistics Regression Model using the hypertuned parameters.
We then evaluated the model performance using the ROC curve and the AUC score.
